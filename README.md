# Description
In the fast-paced society of today, we are focused on modern living. However, with this lifestyle, we are not always aware of all the dangerous conditions that are experienced while women goes out of house. Factors such as kidnapping maneuvers and hazardous conditions, which often contribute to dangerous condition to the women. In recent years, there has been tremendous growth in smartphones embedded with numerous sensors such as accelerometers, Global Positioning Systems (GPSs), magnetometers, multiple microphones, and even cameras. The scope of sensor networks has expanded into many application domains such as intelligent transportation systems that can provide users with new functionalities previously unheard conditions. Experimental mobile applications  in the past have included certain sensors to record data preceding test . After analysis, the women safety precautions which took in the past we propose a new system to implement the women safety using the smartphones.

## Problem statement 
Developing a comprehensive women's safety system using smartphones' sensor capabilities to detect and respond to potential dangers faced by women outside their homes. Addressing issues such as kidnapping maneuvers and hazardous conditions through real-time monitoring and intervention. Utilizing sensors like accelerometers, GPS, magnetometers, microphones, and cameras to create a robust safety solution. Designing an intuitive mobile application interface for easy access and utilization of safety features by women. Ensuring privacy and security measures are integrated into the system to protect user data and maintain trust.

# ## Techstacks used 
sql,java
## How to run locally
- Login into the application
- Give all the required permissions to access (GPS,CONTACTS)
- Enter the numbers of your emergency contacts
- Save the numbers
- now close the app and shake your mobile 
- The app will send your location to the emergency contacts and it call's for the first saved number

 # whats next plan
- Conduct in-depth research on existing women's safety apps and systems to understand strengths, weaknesses, and user feedback.
- Collaborate with experts in sensor technology, data analytics, and women's safety advocacy to design an innovative and effective safety solution.
- Develop a prototype of the women's safety system integrating advanced sensor capabilities and user-friendly mobile application interfaces.
- Conduct extensive testing and user trials to gather feedback, refine features, and improve overall system performance.
- Partner with relevant organizations, law enforcement agencies, and community stakeholders to ensure widespread adoption and impact of the women's safety system in real-world scenarios.
